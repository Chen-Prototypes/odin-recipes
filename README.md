# odin-recipes

This is a project from theOdinProject.com. This is a short project to practice 
1. some of the HTML i've learned,
2. Git in the command line,
3. writing proper commit messages,
4. some basic CSS styling.

This is a simple HTML page that links to some cooking recipes inspired from Guild Wars 2.
