    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 medium butternut squash, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder (or to taste)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Optional: Pumpkin seeds or fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion,
        and sauté until it becomes translucent and starts to brown, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and ginger to the pot and sauté for another minute
        until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cubed butternut squash to the pot. Sprinkle over the chili
        powder, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine and cook for a
        couple of minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce
        the heat, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes or
        until the butternut squash is tender and can be easily pierced with a
        fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the butternut squash is cooked, blend the soup until smooth. You
        can use an immersion blender directly in the pot, or transfer the soup
        to a counter top blender (in batches, if necessary) and then return it
        to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the coconut milk until well combined. If necessary, you can
        adjust the seasoning at this point, adding more salt, pepper, or spices
        to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the soup into bowls. If desired, garnish with a swirl of extra
        coconut milk, a sprinkling of pumpkin seeds, or some fresh cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm and enjoy your sweet and spicy butternut squash soup,
        inspired by Guild Wars 2!
