    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the marinade: In a medium bowl, mix together the olive oil, soy
        sauce, honey, minced garlic, ground ginger, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces. Place the meat into the bowl with the
        marinade. Mix well until all the meat is coated. Cover and refrigerate
        for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Cut the bell peppers, red onion, and zucchini into 1-inch chunks.</li>
      <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Assemble the kabobs: Thread the marinated meat, bell peppers, onion,
        zucchini, and pineapple chunks onto skewers, alternating as you go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the kabobs onto the grill. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side
        or until the meat is fully cooked and vegetables are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before
        serving. Enjoy your Guild Wars Drake Kabobs!
