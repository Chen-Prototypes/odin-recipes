        Cut the meat into 1-inch pieces. Place the meat into the bowl with the

      <li>Cut the bell peppers, red onion, and zucchini into 1-inch chunks.</li>
      <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>

        zucchini, and pineapple chunks onto skewers, alternating as you go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the kabobs onto the grill. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side
